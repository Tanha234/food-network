        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I love to think about, write about, and share and eat food. My true passion, however, is helping others discover their love of cooking. Like most of you, I am not formally trained in the culinary arts. I'm far from being a Chef, but I feel confident in my cooking skills and I know that you can feel the same way.When you prepare your own meals, you have more control over the ingredients. By cooking for yourself, you can ensure that you and your family eat fresh, wholesome meals. This can help you to look and feel healthier, boost your energy, stabilize your weight and mood, and improve your sleep and resilience to stress.</p>
