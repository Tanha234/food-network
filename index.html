            <h2 class="eat">Fast delivery</h2>
            <p>In general, hot or cold items that have some weight to them retain their quality well in transit. Bowl meals, marinated items, scrambles, wraps, cold sandwiches, salads and soups are all good examples.The food is normally done within about 10-15 minutes. things like traffic (don't expect quick delivery during rush hour) wrong directions, or multiple orders grouped together will slow things down extremely.Upon arriving, you shouldn't have to wait more than a minute or two to be acknowledged. Once seated, it should take no more than 2 to 3 minutes before a server acknowledges you.</p>
